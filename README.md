Prompt Forge is a prompt engineering tool designed to help users create, test, and optimize prompts for interacting with large language models (LLMs).

## Key Features

- Local-First: All data is stored locally in the browser and never uploaded to any server, ensuring the privacy and security of your prompts and data.
- Open-Source: Fully open-source code that you can review, modify, or contribute to at any time to meet your specific needs.
- Powerful Playground: Provides an intuitive interface for testing and debugging prompts, allowing real-time result viewing and adjustments.
- Evaluation with LLM-as-a-User: Uses LLMs as simulated users to evaluate and compare different prompts, providing objective feedback.
- Prompt Versioning: Easily track and manage different versions of prompts, compare changes, and roll back to previous versions when needed.
