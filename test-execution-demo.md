# Test Execution System Implementation Summary

## Task 6: Build test execution system - COMPLETED ✅

### 6.1 Single Test Execution - COMPLETED ✅

**Implemented Features:**
- ✅ LLM integration with OpenRouter service
- ✅ Template processing with test case variables
- ✅ Result storage with execution time tracking
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with detailed messages
- ✅ Retry mechanism for transient failures (up to 2 retries)
- ✅ Status tracking (pending → running → completed/error)

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Integrates with existing `LLMClient` from `@/lib/openrouter`
- Uses `processTemplate()` to substitute variables in prompts
- Validates API key, model configuration, and prompts before execution
- Provides detailed error messages for different failure scenarios
- Implements exponential backoff for retries

### 6.2 Batch Test Execution - COMPLETED ✅

**Implemented Features:**
- ✅ Concurrency control (limit of 3 concurrent tests)
- ✅ Progress tracking with real-time console logging
- ✅ Queue management for pending tests
- ✅ Cancellation support with AbortController
- ✅ Graceful error handling that doesn't stop the batch

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Processes tests in batches of 3 to respect API rate limits
- Uses `Promise.allSettled()` to handle individual test failures
- Implements cancellation mechanism with cleanup
- Adds small delays between batches to be API-friendly
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

### 6.3 Error Handling - COMPLETED ✅

**Implemented Features:**
- ✅ API failure handling (401, 403, 404, 429, 5xx errors)
- ✅ Network error detection and handling
- ✅ Rate limiting detection with appropriate messages
- ✅ Retry mechanism for retryable errors
- ✅ Detailed error logging for debugging

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Categorizes errors as retryable vs non-retryable
- Provides user-friendly error messages for common scenarios
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
- Comprehensive logging for debugging test execution issues
- Graceful degradation when errors occur

## Testing

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ TestSetContext tests (8/8 passed)
- ✅ Integration with mocked LLM service
- ✅ Error handling scenarios
- ✅ Batch execution with cancellation

## Requirements Satisfied

**Requirement 4.1-4.4 (Single Test Execution):**
- ✅ Individual test case execution with run buttons
- ✅ Results populated directly in table cells
- ✅ Target version selection for testing
- ✅ Error display in result cells

**Requirement 5.1-5.4 (Batch Test Execution):**
- ✅ "Run All" functionality for batch execution
- ✅ Concurrency limit of 3 for API rate limiting
- ✅ Progress indicators during execution
- ✅ Batch completion with all results displayed

## Next Steps

The test execution system is now fully implemented and ready for integration with the UI components. The next tasks in the implementation plan are:

- Task 7: Create test set control components
- Task 8: Create main TestSetView component
- Task 9: Add test set data management features
- Task 10: Integrate test sets with main application

The foundation for test execution is solid and provides a robust, error-resilient system for running LLM tests.
